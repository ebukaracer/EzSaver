## Features
- Supports encryption(AES)
- Custom-type JSON serialization
- Supports file saving of various extensions
- Includes a Menu window for various operations
- Includes a Demo to help you quickly get started

## Installation
_Inside the Unity Editor using the Package Manager:_
- Click the **(+)** button in the Package Manager and select **"Add package from Git URL"** (requires Unity 2019.4 or later).
-  Paste the Git URL of this package into the input box: https://github.com/ebukaracer/EzSaver.git#upm
-  Click **Add** to install the package.
-  If your project uses **Assembly Definitions**, make sure to add a reference to this package under **Assembly Definition References**. 
    - For more help, see [this guide](https://ebukaracer.github.io/ebukaracer/md/SETUPGUIDE.html).

## Dependencies
This package depends on **Newtonsoft Json (v3.2.1)**. If it's not already available in your project, you can install it via the Unity Package Manager:
- Click the **(+)** button and select **"Add package by name"**
- Enter the package name: `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
-  Click **Add**

## Setup
After installation, use the menu options:
- `Racer > EzSaver > Create EzSaverConfig?` to initialize and create the required `config` asset, necessary for the package to work.
- `Racer > EzSaver > Import Elements` to import the prebuilt elements(prefabs) of this package, which will speed up your workflow.
## Quick Usage
After importing the package's **Elements**, locate the **EzSaverManager** prefab and add it to the scene where you want to enable save functionality.
#### Initialize a save-file:
``` csharp
internal class Person  
{  
    public int Age { get; set; }  
}

private Person _person;
private int _highscore;
private EzSaverCore _ezSaverCore;

private void Awake()    
{  
    // Initializes and sets up a save-file  
    _ezSaverCore = EzSaverManager.Instance.GetSave("Save.txt");  
      
    // Alternatively, you can initialize it with a JSON string-literal  
    // _ezSaverCore = EzSaverManager.Instance.GetSave(@"{""Highscore"": 1}", isJsonStringLiteral: true);

    // Access previously saved content or use the type's default value  
    _person = _ezSaverCore.Read("Person", new Person());  
    _highscore = _ezSaverCore.Read("Highscore", _highscore);  
}
```

#### Update save data: 
``` csharp
public void AddScore(int amount)  
{
	_highscore += amount;  
	_person.Age = _highscore;
	
	// Store their changes temporarily
	_ezSaverCore  
	    .Write("Person", _person)  
	    .Write("Highscore", _highscore);
}
```

#### Save changes to save-file (ðŸ“Œ):
``` csharp
// Find a suitable place to call Save() once.
private void OnDisable()  
{
	// Commit the overall changes to the initialized 'Save.txt' file
	_ezSaverCore.Save();
}
```

#### Clear save data:
``` csharp
_ezSaverCore  
    .Clear("Person", _person)  
    .Clear("Highscore", _highscore);
```

#### Delete save-file:
``` csharp
_ezSaverCore.DeleteFile();
```

## Samples and Best Practices
- Always generate a unique set of keys for each project and back them up securely. Avoid using the default keys provided during installation.
- In the case of any updates to newer versions, use the menu option: `Racer > EzSaver > Import Elements(Force)` 
- Optionally import this package's demo from the package manager's `Samples` tab.
- To remove this package completely(leaving no trace), navigate to: `Racer > EzSaver > Remove package`

## FAQs
**Q1. What platforms are supported?**
> Tested on Android, Windows, and WebGL (see Q2). Probably supported on macOS and iOS.

**Q2. Will it really work for WebGL builds?**
> Partially. Since WebGL doesn't allow file system access, save-files cannot be stored traditionally. As a workaround, you can initialize save data as a string literal and use **PlayerPrefs** to store the final save state.

**Q3. Is save data encrypted? How can I manage the keys?**
> Yes, encryption is supported and optional during initialization. The current encryption keys can be found in the Config Asset under:  
> `Racer > EzSaver > Menu > Config Asset`.

**Q4. What could cause data loss?**
> Imagine this scenario: You deploy a project `xyz` using credentials `abc` (save-keys). Later, if you generate new credentials `cba` for the same project `xyz`, all previous save data tied to `abc` will be overwritten and lost. To prevent this, always back up your credentials and restore them when needed using the Config Asset.

**Q5. Does that mean I should never change the current credentials?**
> Not necessarily! You can generate new credentials anytime during development. If potential data loss isn't a concern, feel free to proceed.

**Q6. Can I modify the contents of the save file?**
> Absolutely â€” as long as encryption is disabled. Modifying an encrypted save file will cause decryption to fail, resulting in data loss. Itâ€™s recommended to only modify the plain JSON string when encryption is turned off.

**Q7. Can different save files have different credentials within the same project?**
> Technically yes, but itâ€™s risky and may lead to data corruption or loss. A safer approach is to generate and back up a unique set of credentials per project â€” for example:  
> `Project A` â†’ `abc`,  
> `Project B` â†’ `xyz`.  
> However, multiple projects can still share the same credentials if necessary.

**Q8. What if I forget to save after making modifications?**
> If automatic saving is enabled (which it is by default), **EzSaverManager.cs** will handle this for you. Note that automatic saving and on-the-go saving only work if you initialized from a file source. If initialized from a string literal, you'll need to manually define save trigger points.
